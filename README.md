# react-webpack-starter

Starter kit for all my react-redux based projects

[react-css-modules](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules)

Webpack Setup
- [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader) converts scss files to files
- [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) loads up the css
- [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) converts the css into inline stylesheets
- [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) extracts all styles into a standalone `style.css` file
